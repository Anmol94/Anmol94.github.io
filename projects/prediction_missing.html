                <br><b>Project mentor: Professor Mehul Raval, SEAS, AU</b></br>

                <br><b>1. Introduction</b></br>
            <p>Sasaki Database consists of the carcinogenicity results obtained as a result of treating the DNA obtained
                from different mice organs (e.g. colon, liver, stomach, brain, bone marrow and kidney) with different
                chemical compounds. The specific chemical compounds have been encoded according to their groups. The
                important input parameters given are compound I.D., compound name, route (i.e. If the compound has been
                introduced orally or through intravenous routes), strain (i.e. Types of mice like ddy and winstar),
                number of sampling hours and the dose of that particular compound. The outputs obtained are the comet
                essay tail lengths observed for the different organs' DNA. The DNA is negatively charged. It is put
                between charged plates and the compounds are introduced on it. Depending on the carcinogenicity of the
                introduced compounds, the DNA shows fragmentation. These fragments being negatively charged get
                attracted to the positive plate and hence end up leaving behind a tail.More the fragmentation, the
                longer is the tail length observed. Thus, this gives us an idea of the carcinogenicity of the introduced
                compound.</p></p>
            <p>
                <br><b>3. Problem Statement:</b></br>
            <p>The goal was to predict the missing comet essay tail length values using the tail length values already
                given for the different compounds and organs.</p></p>
            <p>
                <br><b>4. Solution</b></br>
            <p>The compounds were encoded using their IDs. The strain and route values were encoded as well; the two
                kinds of routes i.e. “ip” and “op” were encoded using 0 and 1. All the five parameters i.e.Encoded
                compounds, strains, routes, sampling time and sampling dose were taken as input parameters. Each of the
                tail length value columns for the different organs were considered one at a time as an output for
                training the machine and predicting the missing values for that particular organ in consideration. Non
                linear and linear regression was used to predict the missing values. Also all input parameters were
                scaled down using their mean and maximum value.</p></p>
            <p>
                <br><b>5. Model:</b></br>
            <p>
                The linear regression model used, tried to fit a line through the set of the given values and then used
                this best fit to predict the missing values.<br>
                Also, used a regression fit used the sigmoid function( i.e. 1/(1+x^theta) where theta is the array of
                all input parameters) and predicted the missing values.<br>
                The learning rate-alpha and the number of iterations were selected separately for each organ.<br>
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><b>6. Testing</b></br>
            <p>Once the values were predicted using a certain algorithm, in order to check their accuracy the set of
                already given values was divided in a ratio of 70/30, where 70 values were used to train the machine and
                predict the rest 30 values. Later these predicted 30 values were cross checked with the actual lab
                answers already given by Sasaki for those 30 inputs. A small sample of the results is shown below:

                <br>7. Conclusion</br>
            <p>Thus, the end goal of this project is to be able to determine the missing tail length values of different
                chemical compunds. this will help us identify cancerous compunds. This will also help us to decrease the
                usage of cancerous compunds. This project was selected amongst 6 contestants chosen globally in
                Professor Andrew Ng’s #LearnML contest. <a
