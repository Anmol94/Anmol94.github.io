                <br><b>Aim</b></br>
            <p>To reduce health vulnerabilities of illiterate low-income rural women by increasing
                their
                healthcare
                awareness.</p>
            <p>
                <bold><br><b>User Survey and Analysis</b></br>
            <p>We carried out field research in the villages in and around Ahmedabad interviewing
                rural
                women,
                doctors
                and medical staff working at local health centres. We observed and realised that
                problems
                like
                early
                marriages and young mothers along with illiteracy, carelessness and sometimes even
                hesitation to
                seek
                timely medical assistance were the key causes of a high mortality rate amongst these
                rural
                women
                and
                new
                born babies. Illiteracy was a major hurdle to their learning about healthcare
                information
                and
                there
                was
                a resistance to formal methods of learning due to issues related to embarrassment,
                orthodoxy,
                household
                responsibilities, lack of resources etc.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><b>Ideation</b></br>
            <p>Based on the user analysis, we concluded that any solution designed to address this
                challenge
                must
                have
                the following characteristics: (1) It must be very low cost and ideally free, (2) It
                must be
                flexible
                with respect to time so that they can use it at their convenience given their
                household
                responsibilities, (3) It must be enjoyable enough not to cause boredom and ensure
                continuity
                and
                (4)
                It
                must be able to target the right topics and also upgrade as they progress.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><b>Proposed Solution</b></br>
            <p>We designed a free Voice Assisted Mobile Service – <a href="http://www.kahinee.in" target="_blank">Kahinee, A Spirited Storyteller.</a>
                This
                was
                a
                free
                mobile service (we had observed that almost all of them had basic mobile phones).
                The
                women
                could
                dial
                in free of charge to these mobile numbers and listen to interesting stories, audio
                plays
                and
                local
                folk-lore at their convenient time. The stories and folk-lore, designed in their
                local
                language
                and
                accent, contained within them key instructions and information about
                important/current
                healthcare
                matters. Initially the aim was to impart awareness about maternal and child care,
                nutrition,
                anaemia
                and
                government health policies as well as facilities. The call data was collected in the
                cloud
                for
                analysis
                and potential automated learning based improvements. This could be used to decide
                the
                topics
                to
                be
                prioritized, the frequency and relay-times for different topics, the topics to
                upgrade
                content
                on
                etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                After having come to this stage we learnt about the activities of <a href="http://barakatbundle.org/" target="_blank">Barakat Bundle, USA</a>
                and
                seeing
                synergy, we approached and collaborated with them for pilot tests in the Jhagadia
                district
                at
                Bharuch.
                The pilot test feedback was very encouraging.
            </p>
            <p><br><b>A Future Possibility</b></br>
            <p>
                A future extension of this idea could be to add a facility using which people in
                rural
                areas
                can
                leave
                an audio note describing their symptoms in their local language which can be
                answered
                using
                an
                audio
                note by doctors on the Kahinee network asynchronously.
